There are days when I feel thankful for living where I live now. 
We are so accustomed to the high standard of living we get here in Europe, that we always seem to be so unsatisfied about what we have (our economy, education, health care systems etc...).  
And I think that's great because there's still so much to do in our so-called developed countries to cut down disparities and injustice both internally and at an international scale... But still, I think it is essential to step back from time to time and fully appreciate what we have: a society in which most people can afford descent conditions of life (including health, accommodation, food and water access), study, get employed or even start a business, and be allowed to have a say when it comes to choose our representatives and expressing our political views, without risking our lives.

However, if you'd tell me about democracy in Europe, most days I would tell you it's an illusion and that the very concept of the election in the form we know it - choosing from a handful of people who claim they are savvy enough to be able to run our countries - is absurd. I would develop and say that a system were banks and lobbyists have more influence on our politics than us - the 99% citizens of these countries - and where our representatives write themselves the constitutions that are supposed to protect us from their greed and self-interest, should maybe not be called a democracy.

But today, that's not my point. Because today I realized that it's been 8 months I've been benefiting from a new right, without even being aware of it. Since April this year, citizens of Europe can make direct law proposals to the European Commission, provided that they've circulated a petition that accumulated 1 million signatures. Now, I don't know how that sounds to you, but for me it's a great step towards more civil liberties and another possibility to have a voice to shape the future we want. 

It took a lot of energy, protests and violence for our ancestors to acquire universal suffrage. Direct action, whether violent or not, proved to be effective more than once (examples include the US civil right movement, boycotts during the Apartheid in South Africa and more recently actions by the Climate Rush in the UK and many others on climate change). But while I believe that in some situations, direct action is necessary to attract public attention on specific problems and put pressure on our representatives and corporations, I also think that allowing citizens and all stakeholders to take part proactively in dialogue, can be much more time effective and achieve better results.

As opposed to most forms of direct actions, the ECI instrument is not intended to be used to express dissent. Instead, it appeals for everyone's creativity to create new law that match their inner values. 

There are specific requirements for an ECI to be accepted and considered by the European Commission, all detailed on [its website](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative). However, the most determinant factors are how much energy you put into it, how clear your message is, how well you communicate about it, how well you deal with opposition and most importantly how much direct support you get to do all this.

There are already [a few ECIs that are opened for voting](http://ec.europa.eu/citizens-initiative/public/initiatives/ongoing), including one on Ecocide and another on rights to water, and I can only encourage you to go have a good read through, and vote if it sounds like you.

In times when one fifth of the global population don't have access to sufficient food and safe water, when natural resources have never come shorter, when climate is becoming so unpredictable and our future so unsure, I think it is time to reconcile with politics (that is, taking control of it) and strive to find the inspiration it takes to create a future that match our ideals. But don't look at it with a wary eye, it's the most unexpected opportunity for you to get involved in the most exiting challenges of all times!
